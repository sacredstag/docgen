title: PVC Mount Fails After Node Reboot
severity: high
audience: L2, L3
platforms: [OpenShift, Kubernetes]
summary: |
  Document troubleshooting steps when PVCs fail to remount after OpenShift nodes reboot or failover.
  Common issues include CSI driver restarts, reclaimPolicy misconfigurations, and pod affinity constraints.

cli_commands:
  - kubectl get pvc
  - kubectl describe pvc <claim-name>
  - kubectl logs -n kube-system -l app=csi-node
  - journalctl -u kubelet
  - lsblk
  - mount | grep /var/lib/kubelet

errors_to_cover:
  - MountVolume.Setup failed
  - CSI driver not registered
  - volume not found
  - reclaim policy mismatch

section_tips:
  overview: Include 2-3 sentences on why this issue occurs and what environments are affected.
  validation: Inject log patterns and example CLI output blocks.
  faq: Include at least three L3-focused edge questions.
  steps: Cover pod/node isolation, PVC binding behavior, and reclaim behavior.

steps:
  - Verify PVC status:
      cmd: kubectl get pvc
      desc: Check if the PVC is in `Pending`, `Bound`, or `Lost` state.
  - Describe the PVC:
      cmd: kubectl describe pvc <claim-name>
      desc: Inspect Events section for scheduling issues or reclaim policy mismatch.
  - Check CSI node logs:
      cmd: kubectl logs -n kube-system -l app=csi-node
      desc: Look for mount errors, timeouts, or communication issues.
  - Inspect kubelet:
      cmd: journalctl -u kubelet
      desc: Review for CSI-related plugin failures or volume attachment events.
