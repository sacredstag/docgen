Title: Subscription Validation Failure in HPE GreenLake Cloud Console

Issue:
After deploying a new HPE Alletra Storage MP array, the system fails to validate its subscription via the HPE GreenLake Cloud Console. The array displays an error indicating unsuccessful subscription validation.

Environment:
- HPE Alletra Storage MP B10000
- HPE GreenLake Cloud Console
- Network connectivity through corporate firewall and proxy

Symptoms:
- The array's subscription status remains unvalidated.
- Error messages indicate failure to connect to the HPE Cloud Console.
- Attempts to manually trigger subscription validation are unsuccessful.

Troubleshooting Steps Taken:
- Verified network connectivity from the array to the internet.
- Checked firewall rules to ensure outbound traffic to HPE endpoints is permitted.
- Reviewed proxy settings configured on the array.
- Attempted to manually initiate subscription validation through the array's management interface.

Resolution:
- Identified that the firewall was blocking specific outbound ports required for communication with the HPE Cloud Console.
- Updated firewall rules to allow necessary outbound traffic.
- Re-initiated subscription validation, which completed successfully.

Additional Notes:
- Ensuring proper network configuration is crucial for successful subscription validation.
- Refer to HPE's support documentation for detailed network requirements and troubleshooting steps.
