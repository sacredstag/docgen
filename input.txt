Title: iSCSI Login Fails on Linux Host with Multipath and Manual Session Restoration

Audience: L3 Technical Support

System: Block Storage — Hybrid SAN (on-prem)

Request:
Customers using hybrid SAN environments are experiencing iSCSI login failures. This usually occurs after host reboots or improper shutdowns where iSCSI sessions are not cleanly terminated.

These environments rely on `multipathd` and native `iscsiadm` for session persistence. Common failure causes include network misconfigurations, stale node definitions, or incorrect session cleanup.

Support engineers need a document that includes:

1. Verifying NIC status and IP reachability to storage targets
2. Reviewing `iscsiadm -m node` and `iscsiadm -m session` output
3. Identifying and removing stale or duplicate nodes
4. Restarting `multipathd` and confirming `multipath -ll` results
5. Rebuilding persistent sessions and testing login flow
6. Performing clean logout and relogin with `iscsiadm`

Include:
- CLI commands inside expand/noformat blocks
- Warning about the risks of force-logging out active sessions
- Info panel note about backing up `/etc/iscsi/` before modifying nodes
- Anchor tags for major sections
- Color-coded panels per documentation guide
- Final section must be titled “Frequently Asked Questions”
